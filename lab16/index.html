			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, our objective was to process a JSON file from an API.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>For this lab, the problem was not so much a technical error, but a policy error. The error in particular seems to be a "CORS policy" error, which I can only assume that there may be a problem with getting permission for the XKCD comic. Since telling our TA about this problem, later updates from my partner said that the majority of the class was having the same problem so we are given the go-ahead to just turn our lab in our current state.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Going over this lab, it was quite interesting using AJAX once again to process JSON files from an API. I'm sure the comic will display fine if the CORS policy error didn't happen, but I guess it's a type of error that can't be solved as easy as mistyped code. </p>
