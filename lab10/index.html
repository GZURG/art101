			<h1>Lab 10 - JavaScript for Web</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>I would say that the challenge was reading thorugh the code for a bit and understanding what the function of the code is instead of just blindly copying the code.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>So far there weren't any major probblems that arose during the lab in terms of the code itself. But I feel like the problem was with me and understanding if the code was actually working.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I should work on understanding the code. I do have tendencies to just blindly copy the code and not take anything from it. So maybe I will look between my notes and past labs to understand the code better.</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
