			<h1>Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>A challenge was remembering to put the parenthesis, commas, and semicolons every so often. In fact, remembering parenthesis was perhaps the main challenge.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The problems with the lab wasn't with the code or anything about the instructions. The problem was me. I forgot to put paranthesis in the object's items. Luckily I figured it out by section after inspecting the elements of the page on Live Server.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The lab overall went fine, and the instructions were easy to follow. But I have to learn that parenthesis are essential. </p>
