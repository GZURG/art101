			<h1>Lab 14 - Debugging Tools and Strategies</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>My partner and I are tasked to look through old labs and use the debugging tools and strategies we learned in class.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The problem for this lab is that there weren't any. Looking through all the labs, there seems to be no problems when I looked through them and checked their functions. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Despite the problem, I would say that even though there wasn't anything wrong with my labs, I do have to recall how I managed to solved through all of the problems in the labs. I did utilized all of the debugging strategies and tools that we went over in class, and when I thought about coming accross probelems in the previous labs' code, my partner and I used all of the debugging tools and strategies. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Debugging</h2>
					<p>Honestly, I got nothing to report, at least from my perspective at the time of making this lab.</p>
