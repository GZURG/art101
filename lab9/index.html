				<div id="challenge">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The minor challenege seems to just be making that each of the sections for the div id were correctly labeled so the JQuery detects them properly.</p>
			</div>

			
			
				<div id="problems">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>So far the problem was to make the button properly change the style of each section, rather than just making a box that was seperate to the sections. Solving this problem was deleting the "minor-section" & "/div" codes of each section.</p>
			</div>


			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Looking at the project, it was pretty tricky at some points, but luckily some thorough inspection throughout the code fixed the problems. It was a bit of a hassle figuring out what was wrong when there were no technical errors. </p>
			</div>


				<div id="results">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>The results should be the button changing the entire style of each section.</p>
					<div id="output"></div>
