			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge seemed to be finding a correct start of the main code. Flipping thourgh notes, and the lecture slides happened very often for my teammate and I to figure out how to start the code.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The problems were very consistant in various lines of code having some undefined problems. Which is to say that I forgot to correctly define some of the code words. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This is a pretty big step up from the previous labs and even though it may seem simple, it proved to be tricky in some areas. It was also a problem making sure that everything was correctly defined. </p>
