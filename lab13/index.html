			<h1>Lab 13 - Loops</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>My partner and I work with loops.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>There weren't any major problems that happened, but figuring out how to correlate the number to the multiple of 3 and 5 was pretty tricky. So W3Schools helped with the solution. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Working with loops are pretty tricky at first glance, but it got easier with the right resources and notes. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Chex Results</h2>
					<p>The results of this lab in particular will be different from FizzBuzzBoom. For my spin, I decided to do the same but replace the words with Chex Mix crackers. Multiples of 3 are bagel chips, multiples of 5 are pretzels, multiples of 7 are m&m's, and multipels of 3 and 5 are Goldfish crackers.</p>
