			<h1>Lab 15 - Using AJAX</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The lab is to show us how to use AJAX to receive and output APIs from the internet.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>So far, our problem with the lab is trying to test out our APIs through our web browser. We were stumbling around for the code in order to test the APIs, but there wasn't much progress, so we eventually skipped to task 3. But for our solution, it turns out that we didn't have to test our API endpoints in the web browser console, but literally anywhere that has the ability to test an API endpoint like JSBin. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The use of AJAX in order to recieve and output APIs was quite a straightfoward process than I expected. Though the lines of code to get to this point is rather tricky, but it eventually got easier overtime as usual. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>The results of using AJAX was to recieve a Dragon Ball themed API. Though the results are quite nice and worked as expected, the creator of the Dragon Ball API wrote the descriptions of the chracters in spanish.</p>
