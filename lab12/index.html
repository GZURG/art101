			<h1>Lab 12 - Conditionals</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>I would say that the challenge is creating a identifier based on the characters of a given name.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The main issue with the lab was how the code seemed to improperly recieve and ouput the faction when the input was divided by 4. The problem was solved by putting some missing semi colons, and fixing the issue with the button listener's code and how it displayed by number of characters in the name instead of just the string of the name. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was a big test for my and my partner's patience and problem solving. I describe it as such because the problem was well hidden in our code and a good amount of time was hastily searching through the code. A pretty big issues was even seaching through the web browser console and how it didn't really detect a technical problem. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Input a name and be part of one of four factions from the video game, Zenless Zone Zero.</p>

					<input type="text" id="placement" placeholder="Enter a name.">
					<button id="findie">Press for your faction!</button>
					<div id="output"></div>
