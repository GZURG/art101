						// Checkers Pseudocode Tasks:
						// To print the board for each turn. 
						// Add all the pieces for the entire game. 
						// Players decide who is team red and team black.
						// Flip a coin to decide who will go first.
						// Whoever wins the coin flips is able to move their checker piece first diagonally.
						// The second will then make the next diagonal move.
						// Repeat turns to capture your opponent’s checker pieces by jumping over them.
						  // If a player’s checker reaches the end of the board it will become a king piece.
							// A King Piece will be able to move diagonally backwards and forwards.
						// A winning player is decided once a player captures all of the checker pieces of the opposing player.
