// Checkers Pseudocode Tasks:
// To print the board for each turn. 
// Add all the pieces for the entire game. 
// Players decide who is team red and team black.
// Flip a coin to decide who will go first.
// Whoever wins the coin flips is able to move their checker piece first diagonally.
// The second will then make the next diagonal move.
// Repeat turns to capture your opponent’s checker pieces by jumping over them.
  // If a player’s checker reaches the end of the board it will become a king piece.
    // A King Piece will be able to move diagonally backwards and forwards.
// A winning player is decided once a player captures all of the checker pieces of the opposing player.
