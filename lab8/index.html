					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>There's wasn't much challenge for this lab so far, but there was a bit of a challenge making sure that all of the code was correct as usual.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>So far, no major problems arosed from this besides the small problems of adding quotations and parenthesis. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This is an interesting way of showing the code's output by showing it through the console rather than the web pages's results section. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>My Numbers Array: [2, 17, 72, 999, 1069]</p>
					<p>My Array multiplied by 3, then add 1: [7, 52, 217, 2998, 3208]</p>
					<p>My Array multiplied by 7, then add 8 (but anonymous): [58, 73, 128, 1055, 1125]</p>
